AWS Services for Data Transfer into Amazon S3

Amazon S3 supports secure data transfers using its RESTful API and integrates with various AWS services for efficient data ingestion.

Key AWS Data Transfer Services:
1. AWS Direct Connect:
   - Dedicated connections for stable, high-speed data transfers.
   - Does not rely on the public internet.

2. Amazon Kinesis:
   - Data Firehose: Captures and delivers streaming data to S3.
   - Data Streams: Processes and stores real-time data streams.
   - Video Streams: Streams video securely to AWS for processing.

3. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration:
   - Improves transfer speeds for large objects by 50â€“500% over long distances.

4. AWS Storage Gateway:
   - Provides on-premises access to AWS Cloud storage.

5. AWS Snow Family:
   - AWS Snowcone: Portable devices for edge storage and data transfer.
   - AWS Snowball Edge: Scalable devices for large-scale data movement with compute capabilities.

6. AWS DataSync:
   - Automates and accelerates on-premises to AWS data transfers.

7. AWS Transfer Family:
   - Supports Secure FTP (SFTP), FTP Secure (FTPS), and Applicability Statement 2 (AS2) for secure file exchanges.
