Amazon S3 Overview:

1. What is Amazon S3?  
   - Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides cloud-based storage for the internet.  
   - Designed for web-scale or cloud-native computing.  
   - Integrates with a broad range of AWS services for building robust workloads.

2. Key Characteristics:  
   - Simple web service interface for storing and retrieving data.  
   - Uses standards-based REST APIs compatible with internet development toolkits.  
   - Supports data organization, cost optimization, security, and compliance.

3. Data Structure:  
   - Data is stored as objects within containers called buckets.  
   - Each object can be up to 5 terabytes in size.  
   - Objects can be accessed via S3 Access Points or directly through the bucket's hostname.

4. Flat Structure with Prefixes:  
   - Amazon S3 has a flat, non-hierarchical structure.  
   - Prefixes group objects under shared names, resembling directory structures but without true hierarchy.

5. Performance:  
   - Industry-leading performance for cloud object storage.  
   - Supports parallel requests for scalable performance via compute clusters.  
   - Performance scales per prefix:  
     - 3,500 requests/second for adding data.  
     - 5,500 requests/second for retrieving data.  
   - Virtually unlimited prefixes for high throughput.

6. Read-After-Write Consistency:  
   - Strong consistency for:  
     - PUT actions (new and overwrites).  
     - DELETE actions.  
   - Applies across all AWS Regions.

7. Key Features:  
   - Metadata tagging for objects.  
   - Data movement and storage across different S3 classes.  
   - Data access controls configuration and enforcement.  
   - Security mechanisms against unauthorized access.  
   - Support for big data analytics.  
   - Object- and bucket-level data monitoring.  
   - Storage usage and activity trend analysis.
